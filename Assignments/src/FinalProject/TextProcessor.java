Please note that the file has to be a .txt file and has to have the same name as the user word, such as devic.txt, and of course this excludes the word exit, and any known words (the words that exist in the word library).
//  Keep in mind that in the output file you need to report the correct number of alternatives found by each of four techniques described in the background section above and it has to report the total number of alternatives found, which should always be (53 * N) + 25 for any word of length N entered by the user at the minimum. Please see the statements printed after each section and towards the bottom of the sample file given above.
